# Discord Nitro Link Generator

### Description:

This script generates links for Discord Nitro subscriptions. However, it's important to note that the probability of a working subscription link is extremely low (approximately 1 in an octillion), making this script practically unusable. I do not take responsibility for any consequences resulting from your interaction with this script.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/discord-nitro-subscription-link-generator.git
   cd discord-nitro-subscription-link-generator
   ```

2. Install dependencies (requests library):
   ```
   pip install requests
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

4. Enter your Discord webhook URL when prompted.

### Notes

- This script generates links with an extremely low probability of success.
- Use this script responsibly and at your own risk.
- Ensure you comply with Discord's terms of service and guidelines.
